#TheLogos
This is a long waited work that i should have begun some time back but being so distracted by life to do so,in a simple sense this is a simple static site served by github and contains my thoughts, spirit-inspired and spirit-thought lessons in the word of God,it embeds within its pages the constantly lessons he teaches and will keep teaching until we are home in heaven together and I deeply pray with all my heart that the Lord,God Almighty and my saviour Jesus Christ through the Holy Spirit will guide them well to speak only his truths and not mine.


Amen
